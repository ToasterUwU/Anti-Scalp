# What is this?

Are you the Gamer that wants a RTX 3080 to play Cyberpunk 2077 on high settings?

Do you crave for a new Ryzen CPU that noone can buy?

Do you finally want to play games on a PS 5, months after it was released?

Do you wanna wear those nice Nike sneakers that you can only buy second hand for double of the original price?

Me too man..


**So i said: "F these Scalpers and their shiny bots, im gonna make myself something that gives me almost equal chances to buy that fancy stuff!"**
