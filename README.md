# Anti Scalp

## What is this?

Are you the Gamer that wants a RTX 3080 to play Cyberpunk 2077 on high settings?

Do you crave for a new Ryzen CPU that noone can buy?

Do you finally want to play games on a PS 5, months after it was released?

Do you wanna wear those nice Nike sneakers that you can only buy second hand for double of the original price?

Me too man..

<br>

So i said: "F these Scalpers and their shiny bots, im gonna make myself something that gives me almost equal chances to buy that fancy stuff!"

<br>

## What it can do

This bundle of code is able to check stock of products.

Meaning you can check hundreds of links in less then a minute. You just have to find links of the products you want, obviously the ones that have normal prices but are sold out, and put them in a .txt file. Just under each other.

Then you start the program and select the regions and products you want to check, and click start.
Thats it, the program will now check the links over and over, as fast as possible. And if it finds a product that is in stock, it will play a sound and open the link in your standard browser, so you instantly click "Buy".

<br>

## What my focus is

This program is supposed to be the answer for people that need GPUs for Gaming and/or their job.
But this can also be used for basically everything. You can also check for CPUs, Sneakers, Lego Sets etc.

So my focus was to make it easy to use, reliable, easy to configure and extendable.

Everyone should be able to use it just fine.

## How to use

- Windows:
  1. Download the installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/ToasterUwU/Anti-Scalp/releases/latest)
  2. Open the installer, install Anti-Scalp
  3. Open Anti-Scalp
  4. Click the "settings" button
  5. click "Open links folder"
  6. In the now opened folder, add folders for the regions you want (Germany, England, USA, Fantasy Land)
  7. In the region folders you can now make .txt files for the products and put all the links in it (RTX 3080, Ryzen 5000 Series)
  8. After adding your region(s) and the product(s) you want, you have to restart the program
  9. After restarting you just tick the boxes you want to monitor
  10. Click start and see the magic happen
- Linux:
  1. Instead of downloading the installer, you download the linux.zip file
  2. Unpack the zip
  3. Open a console in the folder of Anti-Scalp
  4. "pip3 install -r requirements.txt"
  5. "python3 anti-scalp.py"
  6. Now proceed with the Windows steps, starting at number 4

In case you see a message like "Removed ***shopname*** link, ***shopname*** isnt supported. Please add it to the configuration":

- Join the [discord server](https://discord.gg/BFBY5qxu8d)
- Tell me what shop you want to have added in the config
- Send me a link of a product that is sold out and one link of something that is always in stock
- Send me the selectors.json file in the directory of the anti-scalp executable

I will add the configuration for that shop. Im planning on making the process automated, but its not that easy. So it will be a feature for the feature.

<br>

## What comes in the future

- [ ] Easier way to add links then making a .txt file in a folder
- [ ] Auto configuration for new shops
